# MachineLearning

Introduction to machine learning.

Implemented a binary perceptron.

Created an implementation of a small neural network library, which provides code that can be used to build up arbitrary neural networks. Created scaffold that allows running forward and backward passes for arbitrary neural networks made up of component nodes. 

Trained a neural network to approximate sin(x), using both odd and even regression models.

Trained a network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Performed approximate Q-learning using a deep neural network ("Deep Q-Network", or DQN) to solve the cartpole task. In this task, a pole is balanced on a cart. We can either move the cart to the left or right at each time step, and aim to keep the pole from falling past a certain angle for as long as possible. We formulate this as an RL problem, where at each time step the pole is still balanced we get a (discounted) reward. At each time step, we will receive four features of the current state: the position of the cart, the cart's velocity, the current angle of the pole, and the pole's angular velocity.

Built a smaller neural network model that identifies language for one word at a time. Our dataset consists of words in five languages
